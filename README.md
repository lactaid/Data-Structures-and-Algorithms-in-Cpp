# Study notes for reviewing Data Structures and Algorithms, implemented in C++


**Data Structure**: A method for storing information. These provide the foundation for organizing and sotring data effectively.

**Algorithm**: A method for solving a problem.

Together, they empower programmers to develop efficient and scalable solutions to problems in various domains.
